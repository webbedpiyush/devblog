[Piyush Tiwari](https://webbedpiyush.me) is a Front-end developer, creative thinker, and digital explorer.

If you can't find him in a nearby cafeteria, he'll definitely be hiding behind the digital walls of his analysis, apps, or code. As video games, technology, and music are his fuel, Piyush raised a digital garden to document his journey. Strange, isn't it? Sometimes, he also sings forgotten songs in the shape of [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/webbedpiyush).

## But why?

This space focuses on offering a better insight into the creative process of building software and digital experiences. All the news regarding the stack, improvements, or reflections on the course of events will be expressed here.

Just like the code, a project is without 'why'; it compiles simply because it compiles. So be it, then.
